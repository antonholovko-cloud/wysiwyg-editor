Make sure you have Angular CDK installed (required for drag-and-drop functionality):

```

## Usage

### Import in Module (Angular 14+)

```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { NgxWysiwygEditorModule } from 'ngx-wysiwyg-editor';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    NgxWysiwygEditorModule
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

### Import as Standalone Component (Angular 14.1+)

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { WysiwygEditorComponent } from 'ngx-wysiwyg-editor';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [WysiwygEditorComponent],
  template: `<wysiwyg-editor [(ngModel)]="content"></wysiwyg-editor>`
})
export class AppComponent {
  content = '';
}
```

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the library, run:

```bash
npm run build:lib
```

Or using the Angular CLI directly:

```bash
npx ng-packagr -p projects/ngx-wysiwyg-editor/ng-package.json
```

This command will compile your project, and the build artifacts will be placed in the `dist/` directory.

### Development Build

For development and testing:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Publishing the Library

Once the project is built, you can publish your library by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the `dist` directory:
   ```bash
   cd dist/ngx-wysiwyg-editor
   ```

2. Run the `npm publish` command to publish your library to the npm registry:
   ```bash
   npm publish
   ```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:lib
```

Or for the full test suite:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Demo Application

To run the demo application locally:

```bash
npm run serve:demo
```

The demo will be available at `http://localhost:4200`
